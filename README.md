# Marmelada_Learning_JavaScript
The main idea is create few projects using JavaScript language with HTML and Css.

1 - The first project is a Short version of my own CV.
2 - The second project is a Game consists in having a grid with multiple colours and a panel where a colour name will be presented; the child will click a cell in the grid and that cellâ€™s colour name will be presented in a panel above. Once a cell has been clicked, it will become black. When all cells are black, the game is over. The child will want to click all the cells in the shortest amount of time.
