# Marmelada_Learning_JavaScript
The main idea is create few projects using JavaScript language with HTML and Css.

1 - The first project is a Short version of my own CV.
2 - The second project is a Game that the main idea is to read the color and click over two blocks with that colors, untill the end of the whole table became with no color.
